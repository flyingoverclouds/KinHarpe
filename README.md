# KinHarpe
A virtual laser Harpe with Kinect and Midi synthetizer (because i'm a big fan of Jean-Michel Jarre ) 

Kinect is used to capture video stream and detect user skeleton. 
When a skeleton is detected, virtual laser are deployed. Using you hand, you can 'touch' the laser ray and generate Midi frame. 
Midi frame a played using the Sanford.MidiToolkit.
